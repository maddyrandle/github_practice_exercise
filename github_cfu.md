# Git Commands

1. ```git add``` Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

2. ```git commit``` Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history.

3. ```git init``` Initializes a new Git repository.

4. ```git push``` Moves a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions.

5. ```git status``` Displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot.
